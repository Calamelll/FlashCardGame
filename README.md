## üéØ Abbreviation Lyrics Implementation

The game includes a feature to create abbreviated versions of Thai lyrics to make the game more challenging and fun. Here's how it works:

### Process Steps

1. **Word Splitting**
   - Use Thai word segmentation tool from [Thai Word Split](https://fuqua.io/thai-word-split/browser/)
   - Input your lyrics to get properly segmented Thai words

2. **Text Cleaning**
   - Clean the split words to remove extra spaces
   - Normalize special characters and section markers

3. **Abbreviation Processing**
   ```python
   import re

   # Input text with words and special markers
   input_text = ""

   # Normalize spacing and special markers
   normalized = re.sub(r"\s+", " ", input_text).replace("\\ n", "\\n").replace("[ Hook ]", "[Hook]").replace("[ Intro ]", "[Intro]").strip()
   words = normalized.split(" ")

   # Thai consonant clusters
   consonant_clusters = ["‡∏Å‡∏£", "‡∏Å‡∏•", "‡∏Å‡∏ß", "‡∏Ç‡∏£", "‡∏Ç‡∏•", "‡∏Ç‡∏ß", "‡∏Ñ‡∏£", "‡∏Ñ‡∏•", "‡∏Ñ‡∏ß", "‡∏ï‡∏£",
                        "‡∏õ‡∏£", "‡∏õ‡∏•", "‡∏û‡∏£", "‡∏û‡∏•", "‡∏ú‡∏•", "‡∏ó‡∏£", "‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞", "‡∏≠‡∏¢", "‡∏´‡∏°", "‡∏´‡∏•"]

   # Tone mark rules: map tone marker on the vowel sound
   tone_marks = {
       "‡πà": "‡πà",  # mai ek
       "‡πâ": "‡πâ",  # mai tho
       "‡πä": "‡πä",  # mai tri
       "‡πã": "‡πã",  # mai chattawa
   }

   # Function to extract first consonant/cluster and preserve tone mark
   def extract_abbreviation_extended(word):
       if word in ["\\n", "[Hook]", "[Intro]"]:
           return word

       tone = ""
       # Extract tone mark (first occurrence only)
       for char in word:
           if char in tone_marks:
               tone = tone_marks[char]
               break

       # Handle words starting with "‡πÄ" and followed by a consonant
       if (word.startswith("‡πÄ") or word.startswith("‡πÑ") or word.startswith("‡πÉ") or word.startswith("‡πÅ")) and len(word) > 1:
           next_char = word[1]
           return next_char + tone + "‡∏≠"

       # Check consonant cluster
       for cluster in consonant_clusters:
           if word.startswith(cluster):
               return cluster + tone + "‡∏≠"

       # Default case
       return word[0] + tone + "‡∏≠"

   # Convert each word
   abbreviated = [extract_abbreviation_extended(word) for word in words]
   # Combine into one line
   abbreviation_line = " ".join(abbreviated)
   print(abbreviation_line)
   ```

4. **Output Verification**
   - Review the generated abbreviations
   - Ensure tone marks are preserved correctly
   - Verify consonant clusters are handled properly
   - Check that special markers (e.g., [Hook], [Intro]) remain intact

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Input: "‡πÄ‡∏ò‡∏≠ ‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏ö ‡∏â‡∏±‡∏ô"
// Output: "‡∏ò‡∏≠ ‡∏Å‡∏≠ ‡∏ä‡∏≠"
```

### Implementation Notes
- The script handles common Thai consonant clusters
- Preserves tone marks in their original positions
- Maintains special section markers and line breaks
- Supports leading vowels (‡πÄ, ‡πÑ, ‡πÉ, ‡πÅ)
